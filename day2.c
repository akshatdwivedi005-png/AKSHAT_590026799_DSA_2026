Delete an Element from an Array

Problem: Write a C program to delete the element at a given 1-based position pos from an array of n integers. Shift remaining elements to the left.

Input:
- First line: integer n
- Second line: n space-separated integers
- Third line: integer pos (1-based position to delete)

Output:
- Print the updated array with (n-1) elements, space-separated

Example:
Input:
5
10 20 30 40 50
2

Output:
10 30 40 50

Explanation: Delete position 2 (element 20), remaining elements shift left

/*
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
